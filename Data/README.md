# Data Explanation

This document describes three datasets: **`events_DF`**, **`products_DF`**, and **`ads_DF`**. These datasets collectively represent simulated user interaction data, product information, and advertising details.

---

## 1. `events_DF`: User Interaction Events
This dataset contains 1,000 simulated user interactions with ads or products. Each row represents an individual user event.

- **`Ad_id`**: 
  - Identifier for the ad associated with the interaction.
  - Blank if the interaction did not involve an ad.
  
- **`Interaction score`**:
  - A numeric value representing the level of user engagement during the interaction:
    - `0`: User exited/no engagement.
    - `1`: Impression (user passively viewed the ad).
    - `2`: Interaction (e.g., added to cart, clicked on ad).
    - `4`: Conversion (user purchased or completed desired action).

- **`Product ID`** + **`Product Name`**:
  - Identifiers and names of the product that the user interacted with.

- **`Conversion value`**:
  - Monetary value of the interaction:
    - `0`: No conversion occurred.
    - Positive value: The price of the product if a conversion occurred.

## 2. `products_DF`: Product Information
This dataset details the products that users interacted with.

- **`Company of product`**:
  - The company or brand responsible for the product.

- **`Category of products`**:
  - Classification or type of the product.

- **`Name`**:
  - Name or title of the product.

- **`Price of product`**:
  - The price associated with the product.

## 3. `ads_DF`: Advertisement Details
This dataset contains information about advertisements users may have interacted with.

- **`Ad_id`**:
  - Unique identifier for the advertisement.

- **`AdText`**:
  - The text or description associated with the ad.

- **`AdCategory`**:
  - Category or classification of the ad, aligning with the product it promotes.

---

## Notes:
- Use **`Ad_id`** to connect the `events_DF` with the `ads_DF`.
- Use **`Product ID`** or **`Product Name`** to connect `events_DF` with `products_DF`.
- Interaction scores provide a clear hierarchy of engagement, allowing for detailed analysis of user behavior.
